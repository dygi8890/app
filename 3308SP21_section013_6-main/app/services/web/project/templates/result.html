    This image was first grabbed using a Flask POST.
    <br/>
    OpenCV was given the filepath, ran a quick analysis, then wrote an image file into .../project/static/.
    <br/>
    That drawn-on image was then displayed using that same POST command from __init__.py
    <br/>
    Each circle represents that color channel's center of color mass in the image.
    <br/>
    It says this image's dimensions are: {{ dimensions }}
